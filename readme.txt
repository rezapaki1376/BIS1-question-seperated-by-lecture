in the main repository, there are all questions that are separated by lecture. Files started by TA are related to the topics covered by TA and file 1C is related to 1C application questions, finally, all the rest is related to professor lectures.
I put here both PDF and doc files you can simply edit. The questions with white backgrounds are completely true because they are collected from google Forms with correct answers, but the questions with black backgrounds in some cases have incorrect answers.
Anyway incorrect maybe just 2 or 3 questions you found with wrong answers that it's obvious. 

In the folder of '' Unsure answers'' there are a couple of files with questions the answers are unknown, folder ''correct answers'' related to the files whose answers are true except for ''bis1.md'' maybe in a few questions, you find wrong answers.
In the ''old exams'' folder there are several files related to old exams that some topics are not part of the course anymore.
